Well done, you have now built and run your first full stack DAML Application.

If you want to continue learning, head over to the next parts of this course:

1. [Application Architecture](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/app-architecture.html)
1. [Your First Feature](https://daml.com/learn/getting-started/your-first-feature/)

You can continue to use the [Web SDK](https://www.daml.com/websdk) or head over to the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html) to install DAML on your local machine.

If you have any questions or problems, connect with the DAML Community on [Slack](slack.daml.com).
