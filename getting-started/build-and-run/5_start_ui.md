Back in our original terminal, we can now start the UI by running `yarn start`{{execute T1}}.

This starts the web UI connected to the running Sandbox and JSON API server. Once the web UI has been compiled and started, you should see `Compiled successfully!` in your terminal. You can now [open the UI tab](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com).
