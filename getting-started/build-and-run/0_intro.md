This is the first in a series of three tutorials to get you up and running with full-stack DAML development. We do this through the example of a simple social networking application. The three tutorials cover:

1. How to build and run the application (this tutorial)
1. The design of its different components ([Application Architecture](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/app-architecture.html))
1. How to write a new feature for the app ([Your First Feature](https://daml.com/learn/getting-started/your-first-feature/))

The final application will look something like this:

We do not aim to be comprehensive in all DAML concepts and tools (covered in [Writing DAML](https://docs.daml.com/daml/intro/0_Intro.html)) or in all deployment options (see [Deploying](https://docs.daml.com/deploy/index.html)]). The goal is that by the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a good idea of the following:

1. What DAML contracts and ledgers are.
1. How a user interface (UI) interacts with a DAML ledger.
1. How DAML helps you build a real-life application fast.

With that, let’s get started!
